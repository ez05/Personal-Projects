 *     Summary:
 *     This is the public interface of our memory module. This module 
 *     allows the user to load a program into segment 0 of the memory, allocate
 *     and deallocate memory segments, extract values from specific indices of 
 *     memory, get the next instruction from the loaded program, and load a new
 *     program into segment 0. This module is exported to our operations 
 *     module.

 *     Summary:
 *     This is the public interface of our instruction packing module. 
 *     This module allows the user to manipulate a 32-bit UM instruction word
 *     with a variety of different functions that add and extract data from
 *     requested fields, such as the register numbers, operation code, and load 
 *     values. This module is exported to our operations module.

/* FUNCTION:    pack_instruction
 * Purpose:     pack 4 separate char variables representing different bits of
 *              an instruction into a single uint32_t instruction
 * Arg:         a: the most significant byte of the instruction
 *	        b: the second most significant byte of the instruction
 *              c: the third most significant byte of the instruction
 *	        d: the least significant byte of the instruction
 * Returns:     The 32-bit packed instruction
 * Effect:      N/A
 * Exported to: Operation module. Used when reading in instructions from the 
 *		file
 * Error:       N/A

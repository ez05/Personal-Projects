 *
 *     Summary:
 *     This is the private implementation of our memory module. This module 
 *     allows the user to load a program into segment 0 of the memory, allocate
 *     and deallocate memory segments, extract values from specific indices of 
 *     memory, get the next instruction from the loaded program, and load a new
 *     program into segment 0. We implement the segmented memory as a Hanson 
 *     sequence of pointers to Hanson UArrays that store each segment. The 
 *     segment ID of each segment is the index of that segment's address in our
 *     sequence. When we remove a segment, we add its index to a stack that 
 *     stores deallocated segment IDs that can be reallocated in the future.
 *     This module is exported to our operations module.

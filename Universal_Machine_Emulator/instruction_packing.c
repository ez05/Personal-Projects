 *     Summary:
 *     This is the private implementation of our instruction packing module. 
 *     This module allows the user to manipulate a 32-bit UM instruction word
 *     with a variety of different functions that add and extract data from
 *     requested fields, such as the register numbers, operation code, and load
 *     values. This module uses functions from our bitpacking module from
 *     Arith. This module is exported to our operations module.
 *

/* FUNCTION:    pack_instruction

 * Arg:         a: the most significant byte of the instruction
 *	        b: the second most significant byte of the instruction
 *              c: the third most significant byte of the instruction
 *	        d: the least significant byte of the instruction
 * Returns:     The 32-bit packed instruction
 * Effect:      N/A
 * Exported to: Operation module. Used when reading in instructions from the

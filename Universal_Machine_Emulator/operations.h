 *     Summary:
 *     This is the private implementation of our operations module. This module
 *     does the core of the operations in our UM program. Given an instruction,
 *     this module uses private helper functions to execute the requested
 *     operations on the requested registers. This module is exported to our UM
 *     main program.

Compile/run:
     - Compile using
            make MetroSim
     - run executable with
            ./MetroSim stationsFile passFile [commands]


Program Purpose:
Phase 1: build a PassengerQueue class which represents a queue of Passenger 
instances. PassengerQueue will later be used in building an instance of the 
train. Moreover, each station will also utilize PassengerQueue to "store" 
the passenger currently waiting at each respective station.

Phase 2: build a MetroSim class stiumulates the actual train station and the
train. PassengerQueue and Passenger class are used in the implementation of
MetroSim class. The stimulation encapsulates a train, which moves between each
station, and a list of stations, which of each contains a name, a bool value 
that represents the position of the train, and a PassengerQueue representing 
a list of passengers. Passengers are added to any stations and are picked 
up when the train arrives at that station. They are dropped off when the train
arrives at their destination.

Acknowledgements: 
- Used an external library called vector.
- Used output stream "fstream"
- Used input/output stream "iostream"

Files: 

main.cpp:
     Main file handle simple driver functions such as reading in files, check
     for invalid commands, and invalid files. Main.cpp creates an instance of
     MetroSim.

MetroSim.cpp:
     Implementation of MetroSim class. Main functionality of running the Metro 
     Simulation, should be able to move trains and deal with passengers going 
     on/off the train. MetroSim.cpp initialises an instance of MetroSim using
     the given input staiton files. And prints the train&station status to 
     terminal and exiting passengers to the given output file.

MetroSim.h:
     Interface of MetroSim class.

stations.txt:
     an example file containing a list of stations.

the_metroSim:
     reference implementation for students to compare output

PassengerQueue.cpp:
     Implementation of PassengerQueue class. The class utilizes the 
     implementation of the Passenger class to represent a list/queue
     of Passengers.

PassengerQueue.h:
     Interface of PassengerQueue class.

Passenger.cpp:
     Implementation of Passenger class. The class represent a single 
     passenger who has an id, the numerical value of the starting station, 
     and the numerical value of the arriving station.

Makefile:
    Links and compiles all files.

Project: Sudoku and unblackedges

Program Sudoku:
The syntax of the sudoku command is: ./sudoku [ filename ]
where filename is the (optional) name of an input graymap file; if there is no 
filename argument, input data is on standard input.

We define correct input as a single portable graymap (i.e., pgm) file. 
If the input is not correct, Sduoku should terminate with a checked run-time 
error. 

Otherwise, if the input is correct and if the graymap file represents a solved sudoku puzzle, 
- Sudoku exits with a code of 0.
- Otherwise it exits with a code of 1.


Program Unblackedges:
Removes black edges from a scanned image. The program takes at
most one argument: a scanned image files.

Unblackedges should print, on standard output, a plain (P1) format portable bitmap file which has width, height and pixel values identical to the original file except that all black edge pixels are changed to white.

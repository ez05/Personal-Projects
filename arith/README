To our knowledge, everything has been correctly implemented. 

Architecture of Solutions:
        
        --------------------------- ppm_RGBfloats ---------------------------
        The purpose of this module is to convert between a PPM file and a 
        UArray2 of RGB float values. This module contains two public functions,
        one that reads in a PPM file and returns UArray2 of RGB float values, 
        and one that takes in a UArray2 of RGB float values and writes a PPM
        file to stdout.

        ---------------------------- RGBfloats_CV ----------------------------
        The purpose of this module is to convert between a 
        UArray2 of RGB float values and a UArray2 of CV color values. This 
        module contains two public functions, one that takes in a UArray2 of 
        RGB float values and returns a UArray2 of CV color values, and one that
        takes in a UArray2 of CV color values and returns a UArray2 of RGB 
        float values. 

        ---------------------------- CV_DCTfloats ----------------------------
        The purpose of this module is to convert between a UArray2 of CV colors
        and a UArray2 of floats resulting from a discrete cosine 
        transformation. This module contains two public functions, one that 
        takes in a UArray2 of CV color values and returns a UArray2 of DCT 
        floats values, and one that takes in a UArray2 of DCT floats values and
        returns a UArray2 of CV color values.

        -------------------------- DCTfloats_DCTints -------------------------
        The purpose of this module is to convert between a UArray2 of DCT 
        (discrete cosine transformation) floats and a UArray2 scaled DCT ints.
        This module contains two public functions, one that takes in a UArray2
        of DCT float values and returns a UArray2 of DCT scaled int values, 
        and one that takes in a UArray2 of DCT scaled int values and returns 
        a UArray2 of DCT float values.

        -------------------------- DCTints_codewords -------------------------
        The purpose of this module is to convert between a UArray2 of DCT 
        (discrete cosine transformation) scaled ints and a UArray2 of bitpacked
        codewords. This module contains two public functions, one that takes 
        in a UArray2 of DCT scaled int values and returns a UArray2 of 
        bitpacked codewords, and one that takes in a UArray2 of bitpacked 
        codewords and returns a UArray2 of DCT scaled int values.

        --------------------------- Codewords_file ---------------------------
        The purpose of this module is to convert between a UArray2 of bitpacked
        codwords and a binary file of codewords. This module contains two 
        public functions, one that takes in a UArray2 of codewords and writes 
        a binary file of codewords to stdout and one that reads in a binary 
        file of codewords and returns a UArray2 of codewords.


        --------- RGB_floats.h, CV_colors.h, DCT_floats.h, DCT_ints.h ---------
        These are private struct definitions that are each used in different 
        modules.

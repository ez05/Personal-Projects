I built a word representation (i.e., TF-IDF) to look for similar documents.

The main goal of this project is to generate feature representations of the 
text (i.e., the words, meaning,semantics): represent the strings of words in a 
sentence as feature vectors xn of common length n. The machine is able to find 
relevant documents automatically that are similar (i.e., imagine an online
ebook store, what we are about to build could be used to make recommendations 
based on a userâ€™s history or personal ratings, whether as is or an extended version).

***************************
Objectives of this project:
***************************
- Implement functions to encode the text data into feature vectors.
- Use the feature representations to compare different documents, 
  i.e., find and rank similar documents.
- Implement and understand the use of TF, IDF, and TF-IDF in text analysis.

***********************************
Data Preparation: (Preprocess data)
***********************************
- Dataset: a sonnet collection of Shakespeare
- Removing punctuation, non-English and non-text characters
- Unifying the case (i.e., setting everything to upper- or lower-case).
